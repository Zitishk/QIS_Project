This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of financial factors and their relationship with stock returns. The primary goal is to understand the distributions of various factors, identify potential outliers and skewness, and explore correlations with returns.
### Data and Setup

The analysis uses a pre-processed dataset (`standardized_factors.parquet`) located in Google Drive. 
### Analysis Performed
1. **Factor Distribution Analysis:** Histograms are generated for each factor to visualize their distributions. This helps identify skewness and extreme values.
2. **Correlation Analysis:** Correlations between each factor and stock returns are calculated and printed, indicating the strength and direction of linear relationships. The percentage of non-zero data points for each factor is also shown, providing context for the correlation analysis.
3. **Hexbin Plots:** Enhanced scatterplots (hexbin plots) are created to visualize the relationship between each factor and returns in a more visually informative manner than traditional scatter plots. The hexbin plots, with logarithmic binning, show the density of data points.
### Key Findings and Observations
* **Skewness:** Several factors exhibit significant skewness (e.g., Realized Vol, MaxRet, IdioVol3F, High52, Beta, lnP, TK). The month-to-month variation in skewness is noteworthy and warrants further investigation.
* **Extreme Values:** Some factors exhibit extreme values (e.g., EP, Realizedvol, MOM6m, MOM12, MaxRet, IdioVol3F, Beta).
* **Correlation with Returns:** Realized Vol, IdioVol3F, FirmAge, and TK show noticeable correlations with returns. However, only TK and Return skew appear to have a visually apparent relationship when using the hexbin plots.
* **Temporal Dynamics:** The current analysis uses last month's returns, necessitating further exploration of the relationship between factors and *future* returns. The shape of factors like `High52` and `MaxRet` suggest that this is important.
## Further Research
* Investigate the reasons behind the month-to-month variation in skewness.
* Explore the relationship between Firm Age and returns more deeply.
* Incorporate structural breaks into the analysis to account for changes in market dynamics over time.
* Address survivorship bias by including data on failed firms.
* Analyze the relationship between factors and future returns, expanding the time horizon for more robust predictions.
