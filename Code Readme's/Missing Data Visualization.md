This notebook explores a dataset of quantitative investment factors, focusing on the analysis of missing data and the selection of suitable factors for further analysis.
### Data Loading and Setup
The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries. It then mounts Google Drive and loads the factors data from a parquet file located in a specified directory. 
### Missing Data Analysis
The core of the notebook is dedicated to analyzing missing data within the selected factors.
- **Null Count Analysis:** Calculates the percentage of missing values for each factor.
- **Cumulative Histogram Visualization:** Generates a cumulative histogram to visualize the distribution of null counts. This plot shows the number of factors with a certain percentage or less of missing values. Horizontal lines show the number of variables that can be used while tolerating a certain percentage of missing values:
- **Tolerate 0% missing data:** We can use 7 variables.
- **Tolerate 25% missing data:** We can use 25 variables.
- **Tolerate 75% missing data:** We can use 35 variables.
- **Missingno Visualizations:** Uses the `missingno` library to generate several visualizations of the missing data patterns:
- **Matrix:** Visualizes the nullity of the factors as a matrix.
- **Filtered Matrix:** Two matrix visualizations - one of the bottom 18 factors, and one with the top 24 - provide a closer look at the most and least complete factors, sorted by ascending nullity.
- **Dendrogram:** Illustrates the correlation of missing values between the different factors.
### Usage
1. **Setup:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `missingno`). You may need to run `!pip install missingno` in a code cell.
2. **Data Location:** Update the `data_dir` variable to point to the correct location of your `factors.parquet` file in your Google Drive.
3. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the cells sequentially. The visualizations and analysis will provide insights into the missing data pattern in your dataset, helping inform decisions about data cleaning and feature selection

Next we will clean up our factors through [[Data Preprocessing]]
