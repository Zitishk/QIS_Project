This notebook analyzes stock return data, exploring various aspects of the data and visualizing key statistics. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, distributions, and correlations within the data, aiming to uncover valuable insights for investment strategies.

### Key Findings and Interpretations of Graphs

The notebook generates several plots to illustrate the data's characteristics. Here's a breakdown of each visualization and the key interpretations:

1. **Returns Over Time (Hexbin Plot):**
	- This plot visualizes the distribution of returns over time. Higher density areas indicate more frequent occurrences of specific return values during certain time periods.
	- **Interpretation:**  The analysis identifies periods around 2000, 2008, and 2020 as exhibiting higher volatility, coinciding with significant market events.
2. **Distribution of Returns (Histogram):**
	- This plot shows the frequency of different return values. The kernel density estimate (KDE) provides a smoothed representation of the distribution.
	- **Interpretation:** The distribution of returns shows a near-normal distribution with a negative skew and a high frequency of returns near zero. This is expected, as most days see minimal price movement. 
3. **Distribution of Cross-sectional Standard Deviation:**
	- This plot tells us how volatile the market was in general, again being highly volatile near 2000,2008 and 2020
4. **Distribution of Stock Standard Deviation:**
	- This plot tells us about the stock volatilities. 
5. **Distribution of Cross-sectional Skewness:**
	- The skewness of market changes monthly and even yearly, no discernible patterns. 
6. **Autocorrelation Plot:**
	* This plot displays the autocorrelation of returns for different time lags (up to 48 months).
	* **Interpretation:** Autocorrelation measures the relationship between returns at different points in time. Although there appears to be negligible autocorrelation in general, a small number of companies show a statistically significant level.
7. **Autocorrelation Boxplot:**
	* A boxplot of autocorrelation by lag helps in identifying the variability of the correlation at each time lag.

Overall this note-book helps us get a sense of our returns dataset so that our analysis can be more grounded.

Next we get our firm characteristics i.e. factors [[Getting Factors]]
